        SMSSecure is an SMS/MMS application that allows you to protect your privacy while communicating with friends.
        Using SMSSecure, you can send SMS messages and share media or attachments with complete privacy.

        Features:
        * Easy. SMSSecure works like any other SMS application. There\'s nothing to sign up for and no new service your friends need to join.
        * Reliable. SMSSecure communicates using encrypted SMS messages. No servers or internet connection required.
        * Private. SMSSecure provides end-to-end encryption for your messages using the painstakingly engineered TextSecure encryption protocol.
        * Safe. All messages are encrypted locally, so if your phone is lost or stolen, your messages are protected.
        * Open Source. SMSSecure is Free and Open Source, enabling anyone to verify its security by auditing the code.
